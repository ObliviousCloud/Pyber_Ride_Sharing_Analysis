Assignment - The Power of Plots


![Ride](Images/Ride.png)

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Your objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

***Average Fare and Number of Rides***
In the scatter plot chart, there are three city types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural that Pyber serves and are depicted by  average fare and numbers of rides per city type. As seen in the chart, Urban areas tend to have more riders and have a lower fare compared to suburban and rural areas. Lower fares could be the result of people traveling shorter distances in densely populated cities, as well as supply of drivers meeting the demand of riders in cities. When suppy is able to meet the demand, costs can be lower which attract more customers for Pyber. 

**Total Fares by City Type***
Urabn cities equate to more than of all total fares at 62.7% therefore generating the most revenue from these areas. 

**Total Rides by City Type**
Once again, Pyber has the most rides iniatied in Urban cities at a staggering 68.4 percent. This is huge differential in where rides take place can only be explained by the large amounts of cars in cities. However this information can provide an opportunity for Pyber to focus marketing efforts in suburban and rural areas to generate rides. 

**Total Drivers by City Type**
Finally in the last chart the amount of drivers in Urban cities dominates their share of drivers based on city types at 80.9 %. Pyber can once again use this data to attract more drivers outside of cities which in turn, if there are more drivers outside of cities, the costs can can go down based on a higher supply of drivers.
